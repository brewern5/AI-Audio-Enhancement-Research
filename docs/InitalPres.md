# AI Audio Enhancement

---
## The Problem
- Can we use AI to enhance lossy audio files to near-lossless quality?

---
## Why Solve This?
- Reduce streaming bandwidth for music services
- Save device storage by storing lower quality, enhancing during playback
- Enable near-lossless audio over Bluetooth with lightweight AI

---
## Solution Overview
- Train AI on paired lossy/lossless audio datasets
- Learn differences, reconstruct higher-quality audio
- Use objective metrics (e.g., ViSQOL) to measure quality

---
## Key Goals
- Understand codecs, sample rates, compression, formats
- Implement audio evaluation metrics
- Master AI training, datasets, upscaling
- Train model to convert lossy to near-lossless
- Develop A/B/C testing for user comparison
- Simulate real-world streaming conditions

---
## How We Solve It
1. **AI Model Training**
   - Paired lossy/lossless datasets
   - Upscaling techniques
2. **Objective Evaluation**
   - Use metrics to rate audio quality
3. **User Testing**
   - A/B/C: Original, Lossy, Enhanced
   - Visualize waveforms, spectrograms
   - Playback for each
4. **Real-World Simulation**
   - Mock streaming environment
   - Device-side enhancement

## Milestones & Timeline
- **Week 1:** Research codecs, formats, metrics
- **Week 2-3:** Train AI model, build dataset
- **Week 4:** Build UI for A/B/C testing, display metrics

---
## The Vision
- Smarter audio streaming
- Better sound, less bandwidth
- Real-time enhancement on any device

---
## Next Steps
- Build evaluation test bed
- Train and validate AI model
- Develop user-facing app
- Simulate streaming, deploy on devices
