# Nate Brewer 

**Capstone Project**


---

## Problem Domain

- **Infrastructureless** environments impose **severe bandwidth and power constraints** that **prevent** existing **wireless communication systems** from supporting **human-scale information exchange**.

---

## Solution

Semantic transmission of the **meaning** of the message and reconstruct **intelligable audio** on the receiving end for **human-understanding** 

---

## Implementation:
- **LoRa mesh network** for transmission and reception - providing a **low-power**, **long-range** interface

- **Sender AI** Extracts semantic meaning from speech

- **Receiever AI** Reconstructs intelligable audio from semantic payload

---

# Features/Requirements
