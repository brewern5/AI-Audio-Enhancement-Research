# Nate Brewer 

**Capstone Project**


---

## Problem Domain

- **Infrastructureless** environments impose **severe bandwidth and power constraints** that **prevent** existing **wireless communication systems** from supporting **human-scale information exchange**.

---

## Solution

Semantic transmission of the **meaning** of the message and reconstruct **intelligable audio** on the receiving end for **human-understanding** 

---

## Implementation:
- **LoRa mesh network** for transmission and reception - providing a **low-power**, **long-range** interface

- **Sender AI** Extracts semantic meaning from speech

- **Receiever AI** Reconstructs intelligable audio from semantic payload

---

## Sprint Overview

### Sprint 1 Goals

- Write research paper-skeleton 
- Testing different sematic transmission methods (TTS, Neural Reconstruction, Template based) 
- Implement LoRa Mesh network 
- Begin AI training 

---

## Sprint Overview(Cont.)

### Sprint 2 Goals
- Refine and continue to train AI models
- Simulation testing
- Implement LoRa network with AI models and begin testing
- Have final paper and submit

---


# Learning with AI
